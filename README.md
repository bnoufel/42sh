# 42sh

## Validated: 125/100

This is about writing a UNIX shell as stable and complete as possible.

You already know many shells and each has its own characteristics, the humble sh present on all the UNIX distributions of the world, the very complete and very complex zsh that you are so many to use without knowing why.

Of course, there are many other shells, like bash, mksh, tcsh, dash, fish, xonsh, and so on.
